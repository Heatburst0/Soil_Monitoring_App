# Soil Monitoring App

A Flutter-based mobile application that monitors **soil conditions** using a sensor device.  
The app collects **temperature** and **moisture** readings via Bluetooth (mocked for now), stores them in **Firebase Firestore**, and displays them in **graph** and **list** formats.
